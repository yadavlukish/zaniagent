# ZaniAGENT improvements

1. We can use a working OpenAI API key. :) 
2. Explore semantic and agentic text splitting. 
3. Explore hybrid search instead of just vector search
4. Use multiple vectors (with different chunk size & overlaps) and use voting between them. (If we are dealing with a complex PDF file)
5. Can go with MLFLOW approach specially while prompt designing.
